# personal-website
The first (and current) version of my personal website. Pure HTML and CSS. Build it while learning HTML and CSS for the first 
time and have slightly updated it here and then since. It's not bad, but not great either. One of these days I'll get around
to completely rebuilding the site from the ground up, make it a lot more professional looking and better all around. 
Oringial website went up in August 2017. Wish I had the original files, but didn't save them separately. Just kept
updating the originals. 

The site does this weird thing where it doesn't display great on mobile (or at least my iphone) despite it looking fine in
googledevelopers tools preview of what it should look like on iphone. Probably just have the mim width set too high, or 
something like that. Still useable on mobile just not perfect. 

Have a lot of personal blog post posted in the articles sections, just some write ups about some movies I saw and liked and 
trips to Comic-Con and places around the country. Most of them are super in depth and I put a lot of work into writing them.
