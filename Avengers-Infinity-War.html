			<b>WARNING: This articles contains SPOILERS for the movie "Avengers: Infinity War". If you have not seen the movie and do not want it to be spoiled, see the movie first then come back to read this article! </b>
			<br />
			<br />
			The newest Avengers movie is here! It’s been showing for a couple weeks in theaters now so I felt like it’s a good time to share how I felt about the film with the hope most people have seen it by now. Needless to say, I was completely blown away. I saw the movie on opening Thursday night, it was a very last minute thing for me. I knew I wanted to see the movie but I wasn’t in a rush. However my brother invited me to see it that night and I had nothing else going on so I figured “What the hell.” 
			<br />
			<br />
			I’m really glad I saw it opening night, there is so much in the movie that could have been easily spoiled online if I had waited to see the movie, and this is really the type of movie you don’t want spoiled. Infinity War is the biggest and most ambitious Marvel Cinematic Universe movie to date! Every MCU movie so far has been leading up to this. It’s honestly incredible they were able to pull it off, the movie includes so many characters from all the different Marvel movies and it brought them all together and gave just about everybody appropriate screen time. 
			<br />
			<br />
			For a while there I was feeling pretty burnt out from Marvel movies. I think this was a pretty common feeling now days from a lot of moviegoers. Who could blame them? This is the 19th Marvel movie released just from the MCU line of movies. They’ve been constantly releasing MCU movies for 10 years now. That’s astonishing. It’s not too surprising that the magic may have worn down some, or has it… This is how I’ve been feeling before going into every MCU movie I’ve seen the last couple years. “Yeah I guess I’ll see it, should be entertaining enough” only to have my mind blown by the end of the movie and come out of the theater complete fanboying and raving about the movie I just saw. 
			<br />
			<br />
			Infinity War was no exception. It’s completely insane that the MCU team has been able to consistently make incredible comic-book movies this entire time without releasing a single “bad” movie. Sure they’re have been a couple that haven’t been as good as some, but I firmly believe there is not a single poorly made MCU movie. There’s clearly a strong passion in the MCU team to make great superhero movies. They’re amazing story tellers and it’s clear that they really love and care about the characters and stories they’re working with. No one has been able to replicate the success of what the MCU has been able to create (Looking at you DC). 
			<br />
			<br />
			The story this time is decently simple, not anything too complex. Which is a good thing because having too complicated of a story would have been distracting with all the characters involved. The heroes and all of their traits and personality’s is what makes these movies so great, good story is important; but strong characters come first. In the end it’s those character’s stories, and if we don’t care about the characters we won’t care about their stories. In Infinity War Thanos is going around trying to collect all of the Infinity Stones to gain unlimited power, he wants to use that power to kill half of all life forms in the universe instantly with the snap of his fingers. He believes that the universe is overpopulated and if something drastic isn’t done then all life will eventually cease to exist from exhausted resources. This plan is of course completely evil and it’s up to the Avengers to try to stop Thanos from collecting all of the Infinity Stones, it’s as simple as that. Of course the thing that makes this story interesting is watching the Avengers do everything they can to attempt to stop Thanos. 
			<br />
			<br />
			Let’s talk about Thanos. Holy shit Thanos. Without a doubt, one of the best villains I have ever seen on film. And he damned better have been! Marvel has been teasing us with Thanos for the last six years! Ever since that after credit scene in the first Avengers movie when we first saw Thanos make an appearance, we’ve been waiting for him to make his move! Only making small appearances here and there in the following released movies and after credits scenes reminding us that he was still out there, waiting…
			<br />
			<br />
			It goes without saying Josh Brolin did an incredible job. He’s one of my favorite actors working in the business today and I don’t think anyone could have topped his performance. He’s obviously pure evil, but I think the thing that makes Thanos such a great villain is that he’s doing these evil things not just for the sake of “being evil” but he truly believes destroying half the life in the universe is the right thing to do and is the only hope for a prosperous universal civilization. There’re moments in the movie where it really seems like Thanos really doesn’t want to be doing what he’s doing, but in his mind it’s the only way.
			<br />
			<br />
			Especially the scene with Thanos and Gamora, Thanos truly loved Gamora as if she was his own daughter. The last thing Thanos wanted to do was to kill his daughter, to him it was either her or all the life in the universe. We see his struggle, and it creates genuine empathy between him and the audience. That connection is what makes Thanos a spectacular villain. All the buildup for Thanos through the past six years, it seemed impossible he would meet expectations; incredibly enough, he exceeded them. 
			<br />
			<br />
			Our heroes the Avengers were of course great as well, it’s pretty insane the amount of heroes that were included; it’s even more crazy that almost all of them had a fair amount of screen time. Let’s do a quick roll call. We had Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, the Hulk, Spiderman, Vision, Black Panther, Black Widow, Dr. Strange, Scarlet Witch, Bucky Barnes, Falcon, and the entire Guardians of the Galaxy team. That’s 18 main characters all having their own place in the story, and I can almost guarantee I’m leaving some out. For the most part I felt like all of these characters had a good amount of time in the movie and contributed to the story in a meaningful way. 
			<br />
			<br />
			Iron Man and Doctor Strange had great screen time together; and Spider-Man of course is always an appreciated addition. The Guardians of the Galaxy didn’t feel like they exactly fit the tone the rest of the movie was going for just right, but they were still acceptable and still great in their own way; out of all the Guardians Gamora shined the brightest this time around. I thought it was pretty strange they didn’t use Hulk more than after the opening scene, but they’re probably just saving his big moments for the follow up movie. Kind of hilarious that in the trailer it clearly shows Hulk running alongside with the other Avengers while in battle on Wakanda (False advertisement much!) Of course we still did had plenty of Bruce Banner and his loveable awkwardness, thankfully. 
			<br />
			<br />
			Thor was badass as always. But you really got to start to feel for the guy (or god I supposed would be more appropriate). He can’t catch a break; he went through all the trouble that entailed in “Thor Ragnarok” which included losing his home planet, and is immediately thrown into the mess that is Thanos’s wrath in Infinity War. We see Thor almost get killed by the power of a star, gain his mighty axe Stormbreaker with the help of Groot and an Eitri (an awesome surprise Peter Dinklage appearance I had no idea about). After all of that Thor comes literally inches away from killing Thanos. But as Thanos said “Should of gone for the head”, or you know…the arm with the Infinity gauntlet. It would have been so satisfying to see Thor defeat Thanos, and it was equally heartbreaking to see him fail. I’ll be cheering for Thor to get his revenge in the follow up film next year. 
			<br />
			<br />
			The only character I wished had a little bit more screen time was Captain America. They make a big deal out of Tony Start trying to contact him for the first time since Captain America Civil War and the two heroes reconnecting, but there wasn’t much more after that. He shows up, tries to fight Thanos some and gets kicked around, and that was about it from what I remember. But hey there were a lot of characters in this dang movie so you can’t discredit the filmmakers too much. Also he looked really badass in this movie so that makes up for it some. I’m a fan of the title “Punished Capt’” that’s been going on around the internet. It relates his character to “Punished Snake” from the video game Metal Gear Solid 5. Honestly they look really similar, and the name fits the profile. In Infinity War Captain has his hair and beard grown out, a much darker toned suit, and a look on his face saying “I’m tired of dealing with all this shit”. If I dress up for San-Diego Comic-Con this year, this is 100% who I’m going as. 
			<br />
			<br />
			As we know, the movie ends with Thanos being victorious. He gains the final Infinity Stone he needed, snaps his fingers, and half of all life in the universe crumbles away like dust. Damn. What an ending. “Mr.Stark…I don’t feel so good…” that line will haunt the many of us for a long time. I honestly was not expecting this kind of ending, I knew things weren’t going to be resolved in this movie because there’s another one coming out next summer, but damn. This movie went to unexpected places, and to just to end the way it did, on such a dark a bleak note, it was truly staggering. 
			<br />
			<br />
			Of course in the next movie our remaining heroes will find a way to bring our deceased friends back from the land of the dead one way or another. Spider-Man is all but confirmed to come back seeing how…well his next movie already has a release date. The only way I could see them getting away with keeping the heroes dead and continue to release sequels to their movies is if they brought in new characters to take over the superhero’s name. Like in the comic’s even though the character died, a new person would come and become the new version of that superhero. For example, Miles Morales becoming the new Spider-Man. Although I don’t quite see the MCU going that far, who knows; anything could happen at this point. 
			<br />
			<br />
			That’s what so fun about all if it, we have no idea! It’s going to be a great time discussing and predicting until we get our answers. My predictions for what happens next follows up is about in line with about what everyone else is predicting. One of our Avengers will somehow get one of the Infinity Stones, and use its powers to reverse some of Thanos’s actions. Such as go back in time with the time stone, or something similar to that. There’s another good theory floating around that anyone killed by the Infinity Stones aren’t necessarily dead, but trapped in the Soul Stone. However they manage to pull it off I’m sure it’ll be creative and satisfying. What I’m really wondering is will all the heroes be brought back? Or only the ones that were turned to dust? Loki and Gamora weren’t killed by the Infinity Stones, so does that mean they’re gone for good? We won’t know for sure until next summer. 
			<br />
			<br />
			So what comes next? We have “Ant-Man and the Wasp” coming out in July. It’s already been confirmed that it takes place before Infinity War so no answers there, though I’m sure we’ll get some kind of after credit scene connecting the two films. In March of 2019 “Captain Marvel” will be released. I’m really interested in this one, I don’t really know anything about Captain Marvel besides that’s she is supposed to be super badass; almost on a Superman level. She’s also expected to play a big role in the next Avengers movie. In the after credit scene for Infinity War we’re shown Nick Fury paging her right before he turns to ash. This most likely means Captain Marvel will be a big part of taking down Thanos in the next movie. Captain Marvel’s movie takes place in the 1990’s and will introduce us to our fabled heroine and show us what she’s all about. Again I don’t expect much connection with the current Avengers situation in this movie, but I can almost guarantee it will have some kind of lead up to the next movie, because the movie scheduled to be released after Captain Marvel is….Untitled Avengers Film! (That’s what it’s called right now, they still haven’t told us the name!)

			<br />
			Watching Avengers: Infinity War was such as fun time. It created this kind of excitement from a movie I really don’t get all that often anymore. The kind of excitement I got when I was 13 and watching one of the original Star Wars movies, just a feeling of pure ecstasy. This is the type of movie people will still be talking about 20 years from now, that’s a huge accomplishment on its own. I know it’s extremely cliché to call anything classic anymore, but true to the meaning of the word that’s exactly what Avengers: Infinity War is. In today’s day in age it’s incredible to be able to create something with lasting impact, in the modern world of entertainment everything is moving so fast and there’s so much more content being feed to consumers then there was even just 10 years ago. Almost nothing remains in a viewer’s conscious longer than a year or two anymore. When something makes the immediate impact like Infinity War did, you know you got yourself something special. It was a great movie and I can’t wait to see what happens next summer when the remaining Avengers assemble.
